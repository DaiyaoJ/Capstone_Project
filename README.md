# Capstone_Project
The idea is to create a web application in Linux with 2FA integrated for remote admin Linux servers. It provides an interface for users to run Linux tasks such as SSH service, firewall service, and print service. An authentication code will be required when running the Linux tasks. 
The main programming languages used in this project include Javascript, PHP, and MySQL.
The 2FA method used is SMS-Based.
